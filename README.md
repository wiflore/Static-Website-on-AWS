# Static-Website-on-AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. 

I deployed a static website to AWS. First, you will create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.
